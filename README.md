# MindTune

The project aims to create a mental state evaluation system by combining EEG analysis with
artificial intelligence. The Unicorn Hybrid Black EEG headset from g.tec captures the user's
brain waves, which are analyzed to determine the emotional stateâ€”whether stressed or
relaxed. Based on this state, the LLM model interacts with the user through a series of
questions, awaiting input and ultimately providing suggestions for mental well-being
improvement.
The entire pipeline is integrated into a web application, offering a user-friendly, accessible,
and dynamic experience.
